In MVC model, the active record design patterns take place in M (Model): 
It link business logic and data access tiers: crud operation.

ORM: Object-Relational Mapping
-classes are mapped to table 
-objects are mapped to records (rows)
-attributes are mapped to values (columns)

Ruby command line:
$ irb 

Rails console
$ rails console
> p = Post.new(:title=> "My first POst", :body => "It is just test!" )
> p.save
> Post.all
> Post.first

In a Rails application, the best place to implement data validations (prior to persisting an ActiveRecord object to the database) are in the Model.
