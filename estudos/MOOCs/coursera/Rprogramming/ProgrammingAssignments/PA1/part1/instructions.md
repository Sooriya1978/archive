Sobre os arquivos de dados:

- 332 comma-separated-value (CSV) files 
- air pollution monitoring data for fine particulate matter (PM) at 332 locations
- Date: the date of the observation in YYYY-MM-DD format (year-month-day)
- sulfate: the level of sulfate PM in the air on that date (measured in micrograms per cubic meter)
- nitrate: the level of nitrate PM in the air on that date (measured in micrograms per cubic meter)

Protótipo da função no R:

pollutantmean <- function(directory, pollutant, id = 1:332) {
        ## 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
        ## the location of the CSV files

        ## 'pollutant' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
        ## the name of the pollutant for which we will calculate the
        ## mean; either "sulfate" or "nitrate".

        ## 'id' is an integer vector indicating the monitor ID numbers
        ## to be used

        ## Return the mean of the pollutant across all monitors list
        ## in the 'id' vector (ignoring NA values)
        ## NOTE: Do not round the result!
}
