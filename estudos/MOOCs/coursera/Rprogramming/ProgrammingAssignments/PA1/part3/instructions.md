- takes a directory of data files and a threshold for complete cases 
- calculates the correlation between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations where the number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is greater than the threshold. 
- return a vector of correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold requirement. 
- If no monitors meet the threshold requirement, then the function should return a numeric vector of length 0.
